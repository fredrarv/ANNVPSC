Installation and run of code VPSC8
******************************************************************
The files required to compile and run the polycrystal plasticity code VPSC (version 8) are:
VPSC8_MAIN.FOR, VPSC8_SUB.FOR, VPSC8_DIM.FOR. As their names indicate, they contain
the main (driver) code, all subroutines and functions, and all arrays and variable
declarations and dimensioning, respectively.
For compilation with the G-Fortran compiler use the command ‘compileVPSC8’ to run
the batch file COMPILEVPSC8.BAT in the command window. Running the batch file creates
an executable VPSC8.EXE. The batch file reads:

@REM This file should be named compileVPSC8.bat
gfortran -fdefault-real-8 vpsc8dim.for vpsc8main.for vpsc8sub.for -o vpsc8.exe
@del *.mod

Using the double precision flag is necessary to guarantee convergence. The
 ‘-fbounds-check’ flag provides a warning when arrays exceed dimension.
 It is not included because it slows down the code but may be added for debugging.

Examples and the corresponding input/ouput files are part of the download package.
Current example file names use Windows backslash and are not case insensitive.
To run on Linux based systems the backslash has to be changed to forward slash in VPSC8.IN.
Also, because Linus is character sensitive, we have tried to match upper and lower case 
characters in VPSC8.IN with those in the file name.
The description of input/output files can be found in Chapter 5 of “Material modeling
with the visco-plastic self-consistent (VPSC) approach – Theory and Applications”,
by Tomé and  Lebensohn – Elsevier (2023). The description of the examples can be found in
Chapter 6.

Installation and run of pole figure plotting code POLE8
******************************************************************
POLE8 is a Fortran code used for plotting the output texture files generated by VPSC8, 
including those containing multiple textures.
The source code POLE8d can be downloaded from the same site, together with the User Manual,
and input/output files of examples.
